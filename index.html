<h4>About</h4>

<p>I like to design, map and build things using technology</p>

<p>Back in late 2019, I decided to try my hand (badly) at learning R
    in order to create Plotly graphs to track construction costs.
    After a journey in Construction and Commercial Real Estate (including
    building offices for a number of Tech companies), my main focus these
    days transitioning into Tech is in learning, applying and building.</p>
  
<p>I most enjoy the software development experience within the sweet spot where 
    design, planning and engineering intersect - where something not only looks great,
    but also built well and clearly understood code-wise. In my free time, I can be found practising code or
    following news on Location Intelligence and Machine Learning.</p>

<p>Beyond my time at the computer, I'm usually out running, swimming or cycling, 
    as well as finding quiet nooks and cranies to catch up on reading and writing.</p>
