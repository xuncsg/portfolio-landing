<h1>Portfolio Repo</h1>

Hello There! This is the repository for my portfolio page (as of 2024). The website serves not only as my showcase portfolio but also as a personal development project on its own. 

On a related note, it also serves as a mental container for some of my coding ideas that I wanted to execute but lacked the technical ability then, as well as my general interest in topics such as Machine Learning and Location Intelligence.  

Enjoy your stay!
